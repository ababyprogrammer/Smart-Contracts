In this contract, the `DEX` class has a constructor that accepts the address of the ERC20 token that will be used for swaps and deposits. It also includes events to log deposits, withdrawals, and swaps.

The contract allows providers to deposit their tokens into the DEX by calling the deposit function. They can then withdraw their tokens by calling the withdraw function.

Providers can also swap their tokens with tokens from other providers. This is achieved by calling the swap function.

The contract ensures that providers can only withdraw a proportional amount of their deposited tokens based on the current liquidity distribution.

It's important to note that this is a simplified example of a DEX. In a real-world DEX, the pricing and matching engine would be more complex, and there would be additional considerations for features like fees and slippage protection. `/ fromBalance; } }`

The contract above allows you to deposit, withdraw, andapped out of a pool, based on the balance of the token in the pool and the swap tokens on the DEX.

When a user deposits tokens, they desired amount of tokens to be swapped. The `totalLiquidity` variable keeps track become a provider on the DEX. The contract calculates the amount of tokens they will of the total amount of tokens deposited into the DEX. The `providers` mapping stores receive as a liquidity provider based on the total amount of liquidity in the pool. information about each provider's liquidity and withdrawal share. The `deposit`, The contract uses the getAmountOut function to determine the amount of tokens the user `withdraw`, and `swap` functions allow providers to depos will receive when they swap tokens.

To use this contract, you will need to importit, withdraw, and swap tokens, respectively.

This contract uses the `Re it into a frontend application or another smart contract and provide the necessary methods to interact with itentrancyGuard` modifier from OpenZeppelin to protect against reentrant attacks.

Keep in mind that this contract does not handle slippage and fee management. The `nonReentrant` modifier prevents the reentran. These features are usually added to more sophisticated DEX implementations.cy of a function.

Additionally, this contract does not account for any gas fees involved in the swap transactions. `/ fromBalance; } } / fromBalance; } } / fromBalance; } }`
